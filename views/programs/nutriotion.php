                            Nutrition and agriculture are two intertwined pillars that play a pivotal role in promoting the holistic well-being of girls and women. 
<br/>At Sympathy Africa, the integration of nutrition and agriculture programs offers a unique opportunity to address multifaceted challenges faced by the girl child
in underserved communities.
<br/>Girls and women are at the heart of communities, but they often bear the brunt of malnutrition and food insecurity, therefore, Sympathy Africa in partnership 
with Nutriworth international recognize and give priority to malnutrition in children. 
<br/>To achieve this, we provide education and resources to mothers, teaching them about the importance of proper nutrition and how to make healthy 
food choices for themselves and their babies. We also distribute food and supplements to ensure that mothers and babies have access to the nutrients 
they need.
<br/>Nutrition is a critical issue in Uganda, as the country faces high rates of malnutrition and associated health problems, particularly among women 
and children. Poor nutrition can lead to stunted growth, weakened immune systems, and increased vulnerability to disease. In fact, malnutrition 
is a leading cause of child mortality in Uganda.
