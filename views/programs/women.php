                            <p class="donation-details__text">
                            Sympathy Africa has risen up with income generating activity project to empower women to sustain themselves financially and improve their standard of living to avert 
the current status of women in the issues that affect their lives. 
<Br/>
The aim of this project is to provide a self-sustainable source of income so as to meet the basic needs of life for instance food, clothing, shelter among others.
<Br/>
In many countries,women’s awareness and participation in the different aspects of life is nearly three times less than that of men (2006 research on ICT Africa) as they are referred to as 
the “weaker sex” among the vulnerable groups. In Uganda, women are considered to be of lower class than men. It is for this reason that a majority of Ugandan women are discriminated 
against, have limited access to education and low economic status.
Furthermore, women face a number of challenges in their daily life which involves domestic violence where some are even battered to death and no action is taken, many are raped, cultural 
practices like female genital mutilation which results into adverse effects, marital rape, low participation in decision making in homes among others.
Interventions geared to improve the position of women in society and to enable them become financially independent have been employed to tackle the issue of gender discrimination with 
the overall aim to bring about women empowerment in communities.
<br/>
Moreover, at regional level, it has been discovered that prevalence rates range from 4.1% to 10.6% in Mid-eastern region and Central region respectively. 
These statistics show a need for development of interventions that can be implemented in order to tackle this issue.
